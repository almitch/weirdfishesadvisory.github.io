    <h2>I solve the implementation gap</h2>
    
    <p>Most conservation organizations are excellent at vision and strategy. Where they struggle is execution: building the systems to support decisions, measuring whether programs actually work, and proving impact to funders.</p>
    
    <p>I've spent 7 years working across government (UK DEFRA), international conservation NGOs, and corporate sustainability programs. I don't just advise—I build, analyze, and deliver.</p>
